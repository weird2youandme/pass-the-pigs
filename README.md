# pass-the-pigs
Simple game to play pass the pigs for multiple users

Copy the directory, start playing by opening create game.  

Rules are easy,  
add as many players as desired (limited to what fits in the screen.

Player can shake and throw. two rnadom numbers are chosen for the possible pig positions and displayed.
Player and stop and save score - Score is added tot he total score and next player is chosen.
Player can shake and hold.  This runs the randomizer but does not thorw the pigs. I added this for all the whiny people who think random is not random.  Use it to burn a random number.
