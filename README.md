# pass-the-pigs
Simple game to play pass the pigs for multiple users

Copy the directory, start playing by opening create game.  

Rules are easy,  
add as many players as desired (limited to what fits in the screen).

Player can shake and throw. two random numbers are chosen for the possible pig positions and displayed.

Player can stop and save score - Score is added to the total score and next player is chosen.
Player can shake and hold.  This runs the randomizer but does not thorw the pigs. I added this for all the whiny people who think random is not random.  Use it to burn a random number if it makes you feel in control.

Logic and statistics found using web searches. Developed each individual pig probability based on 1000 rolls.  
I did not add Making Bacon, this can be added, have a ball.


Enjoy
